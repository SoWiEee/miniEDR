Phase 3 note:
True sandboxing is a large topic. In this project we treat it as a future feature.

Possible directions (future phases):
- Create a restricted token / low integrity process (basic containment)
- AppContainer execution
- Windows Sandbox / Hyper-V isolation (operational workflows)

At Phase 3 we only document the intended interface boundaries.

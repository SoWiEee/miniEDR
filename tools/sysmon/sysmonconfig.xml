<!--
This is a minimal placeholder Sysmon configuration.

Recommended approach for Phase 1:
- Enable Event ID 1 (Process Create) at minimum.
- Optionally enable EID 3 (Network), EID 7 (Image Load) later as you expand detection.

For production-quality configs, you can base this on well-known community configs
(e.g., SwiftOnSecurity). Always review and adapt for your environment.
